Allocate provides a specialized exam scheduling and reservation system for PSUT, designed to streamline and manage classroom and auditorium reservations, as well as optimize exam schedules. The system focuses on addressing the challenges of scheduling conflicts for both students and instructors, ensuring efficiency and fairness in exam planning.

For exam scheduling, the system minimizes overlaps in both instructor and student schedules. It ensures that students will not have two exams on the same day or at the same hour and prevents instructors from having multiple exams scheduled on the same day. This intelligent scheduling feature enhances the overall experience for both parties, fostering a stress-free exam period.
The Reservation system provides:
- Real-time availability overview for classrooms and auditoriums.
- A user-friendly interface to simplify the booking process for university administrators, faculty members, and other stakeholders.
- Tools to forecast and allocate the most suitable rooms and time slots for exams, minimizing scheduling conflicts.


By addressing these critical challenges, Allocate ensures seamless operations during exam periods, reduces scheduling-related issues, and supports efficient use of university resources. This solution directly benefits the university by improving coordination and making the scheduling process transparent and hassle-free for all users.
